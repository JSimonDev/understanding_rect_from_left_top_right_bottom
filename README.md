# understanding_rect_from_left_top_right_bottom

The app provides interactive sliders to adjust the left, top, right, and bottom values of a rectangle, allowing users to visualize how these parameters affect the shape and position of the rectangle.

## Features

- Interactive sliders to adjust the `left`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom` values of a rectangle.
- Real-time visualization of the rectangle based on the slider values.
- Responsive user interface built with Flutter's material design.
- Custom painter to render the rectangle on the screen.
